## Case Title
Smart To-Do Auto Labels & Priority

## Background
Students and busy users often need a very simple task list. Complex tools slow them down. A minimal To-Do app with automatic label and priority suggestions can save time and keep focus on what matters.

## Purpose
Create a small web application where users can add tasks and get AI-based suggestions for a label (category) and priority (importance). Users can accept or override the suggestions. Keep the solution simple and reliable.

## Target Users
Students and beginners who want a fast, minimal task manager with light AI assistance

## Core Functionality

### Must Have (MVP)
- Create, read, update and delete tasks (title required; optional notes and due date)
- Automatic suggestions for **label** (e.g., School, Work, Home, Health, Finance, Shopping, Other)
- Automatic suggestions for **priority** (low, medium, high)
- Accept or override the suggestions before saving
- Filter by label and sort by priority

### Nice to Have (Optional Extensions)
- Smart lists (e.g., "High priority", "This week", "Overdue")
- Export/import tasks (CSV/JSON)
- Simple search

## Data Requirements

- **Tasks:** id, title, notes, due_date, label, priority, is_done, created_at
- **App settings:** default sort/filter

## User Stories (Optional)

1. As a student, I want to label and priority suggestions when I add task, so that organizing is fast
2. As a user, I want to override the suggestions, so that I can stay in control
3. As a user, I want to filter by label and sort by priority, so that the most important tasks appear first

## Technical Constraints

- Python + Flask (server-rendered pages with simple HTML/CSS)
- Storage: SQLite (preferred) or a JSON file for a minimal demo
- AI module: rule-based fallback for suggestions; optional LLM call with JSON output
- Must work locally without authentication or hosting
- If AI is unavailable, the app must still work (default to label=“Other”, priority=“low”)

## Success Criteria

- Users can complete the full task lifecycle (create, read, update, delete)
- AI suggestions appear and can be overridden; app functions with or without AI (fallback)
- Filtering by label and sorting by priority work correctly
- Project structure follows course requirements (planning docs, prompts in repo, runnable app)

## Summary Assessment

This is a well-crafted proposal with excellent clarity and appropriate technical choices. The project scope is crystal clear with specific, measurable goals, and the separation between MVP and optional features demonstrates good planning. The technical stack (Python/Flask/SQLite) is perfectly suited for AI-assisted development and realistic for the 1.5-month timeframe. The inclusion of a rule-based fallback for AI suggestions shows thoughtful consideration of reliability.

The proposal's main strengths include its clear data model, well-defined success criteria, and realistic scope. However, it falls slightly short in a few areas: the frontend specification lacks details about the HTML/CSS approach and user interface design, the AI integration section could benefit from specifying which LLM or API will be used, and most importantly, there is no explicit timeline with weekly milestones. The project scope, while clear and achievable, may be slightly simple for a 1.5-month timeframe with AI assistance, leaving room for more ambitious features.

Overall, this proposal demonstrates strong planning and is approved with minor suggestions for improvement. With the recommended modifications, particularly adding a timeline and frontend design details, this project is well-positioned for successful completion.

## Detailed Checklist Evaluation

### Scope Clarity and Definition (28/30)

- ✅ **Scope Clarity (15/15)**: Excellent scope definition with specific, measurable goals. The proposal clearly defines what the application will do (auto-label and auto-prioritize tasks), who will use it (students and beginners), and what the boundaries are (minimal, simple, reliable).

- ⚠️ **Scope Appropriateness (13/15)**: The scope is well-sized and achievable but slightly on the simple side for 1.5 months with AI assistance. The MVP features (CRUD + AI suggestions + filtering) could be completed in 2-3 weeks, leaving significant time for extensions. Consider incorporating at least one "nice-to-have" feature into the MVP to better utilize the available time.

### Technical Architecture (32/35)

- ⚠️ **Frontend Specification (5/7)**: Technology stack is mentioned (server-rendered pages with HTML/CSS) but lacks details about the design approach, UI framework considerations (even simple ones like forms layout), or user experience flow. Adding a wireframe description or UI component breakdown would strengthen this.

- ✅ **Backend Specification (7/7)**: Excellent backend specification. Python + Flask is clearly specified with server-rendered pages approach. The architecture is appropriate for the project scope and well-suited for AI-assisted development.

- ✅ **Database Specification (7/7)**: Outstanding database specification. The data model is clearly defined with all required fields (id, title, notes, due_date, label, priority, is_done, created_at). SQLite is specified as preferred with JSON file as backup option, showing thoughtful planning.

- ⚠️ **AI Integration (6/7)**: Good AI specification with rule-based fallback and optional LLM call with JSON output. However, it lacks specifics about which LLM API will be used (OpenAI, Anthropic, local model) and what the rule-based fallback logic will look like. The fallback defaults are specified, which is excellent.

- ✅ **Platform Type (7/7)**: Crystal clear platform specification. Web application for local deployment without hosting requirements. Target environment and compatibility are well-defined.

### Features and Complexity (20/20)

- ✅ **User Authentication (5/5)**: Appropriately excluded with clear justification ("Must work locally without authentication"). This is a smart decision that keeps the scope focused and manageable.

- ✅ **Payment System (5/5)**: Appropriately excluded (not applicable to a personal task management tool). No unnecessary complexity added.

- ✅ **Core Features Definition (10/10)**: Excellent feature definition and prioritization. MVP features are clearly separated from nice-to-have extensions. Each feature is specific and measurable. The CRUD operations, AI suggestions with override capability, and filtering/sorting are all well-defined. User stories further clarify feature requirements.

### Feasibility and Planning (14/15)

- ✅ **Technical Feasibility (8/8)**: Technologies are highly appropriate and proven. Python/Flask is well-documented and AI-friendly. SQLite is perfect for local development. The fallback mechanism ensures the app works even without AI, demonstrating realistic risk management.

- ⚠️ **Timeline and Milestones (6/7)**: This is the most significant gap in the proposal. While the success criteria are clear and the scope is realistic for 1.5 months, there is no explicit timeline with weekly milestones. Adding a breakdown of weeks (e.g., Week 1: Database setup and CRUD, Week 2: AI integration, Week 3: Frontend and filtering, Week 4: Testing and polish, Weeks 5-6: Extensions and documentation) would significantly strengthen the proposal.

## Strengths

1. **Excellent Scope Definition**: The proposal provides crystal clear boundaries between MVP and optional features, making it easy to understand what will be delivered and what might be added if time permits.

2. **Well-Defined Data Model**: The data requirements section clearly specifies all fields needed for tasks, showing thoughtful planning of the database schema before development begins.

3. **Thoughtful AI Integration with Fallback**: The inclusion of rule-based fallback and default values (label="Other", priority="low") demonstrates mature thinking about reliability and graceful degradation.

4. **Appropriate Technology Choices**: Python/Flask/SQLite is an excellent stack for this project - proven, well-documented, and perfect for AI-assisted development.

5. **Clear Success Criteria**: The success criteria are specific, measurable, and directly tied to the core functionality, making it easy to determine when the project is complete.

6. **Realistic Scope for Team Skills**: By targeting "students and beginners" as users and keeping the interface minimal, the project aligns well with likely developer experience levels.

7. **Good Prioritization**: The Must Have vs Nice to Have distinction is clear and logical, with MVP features being genuinely minimal and extensions being genuinely optional.

## Areas for Improvement

### Critical Issues (Must Address)

1. **Missing Timeline and Milestones**: The proposal lacks an explicit timeline with weekly milestones. Add a development timeline that breaks down the 1.5 months into weekly goals. For example:
   - Week 1: Project setup, database schema, basic CRUD operations
   - Week 2: AI integration (rule-based logic + optional LLM)
   - Week 3: Frontend development (forms, list views, filters)
   - Week 4: Testing, bug fixes, and polish
   - Weeks 5-6: Optional extensions (smart lists, export/import, search) and documentation

### Major Improvements (Strongly Recommended)

1. **Frontend Design Details**: Expand the frontend specification to include:
   - Page/view breakdown (e.g., main task list page, add/edit task form, filter controls)
   - Form design approach (how will users see and interact with AI suggestions?)
   - CSS framework consideration (plain CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, or custom)
   - Basic wireframe descriptions of key screens

2. **AI Integration Specifics**: Clarify the AI implementation:
   - Which LLM API will you use? (OpenAI GPT-3.5/4, Anthropic Claude, local model like Ollama)
   - What will the rule-based fallback logic look like? (keyword matching, due date analysis, etc.)
   - What prompt structure will you use for the LLM?
   - How will you handle API errors and rate limits?

3. **Consider Expanding MVP Scope**: Given the 1.5-month timeframe with AI assistance, consider promoting one "nice-to-have" feature to MVP status, such as:
   - Smart lists (relatively simple to implement and adds significant value)
   - Simple search (enhances usability meaningfully)

### Minor Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Testing Strategy**: Add a brief note about how you'll test the application (manual testing, basic unit tests for AI module, etc.)

2. **User Story Grammar**: Fix minor grammar issue in user story 1: "I want to label and priority suggestions" should be "I want label and priority suggestions" or "I want to receive label and priority suggestions"

3. **Deployment Considerations**: While "must work locally" is clear, consider mentioning whether you'll provide setup instructions, requirements.txt, or Docker configuration for easy local deployment

4. **Data Persistence**: Clarify whether tasks persist between sessions (which SQLite would provide) or if session-only storage is acceptable

5. **Error Handling**: Briefly mention how the app will handle edge cases (empty title, invalid dates, etc.)

## Recommendations Summary

**Immediate Actions**:
- Add a detailed 6-week timeline with specific weekly milestones and deliverables
- Expand the frontend specification to include page breakdown, form design, and CSS approach
- Specify which LLM API or model you plan to use for AI suggestions

**Before Final Submission**:
- Consider promoting one "nice-to-have" feature to MVP to better utilize the 1.5-month timeframe
- Add a brief testing strategy section
- Clarify the rule-based fallback logic with examples
- Fix grammar in user story 1

## Evaluator Notes

This proposal demonstrates strong planning fundamentals and realistic scope estimation. The student clearly understands the importance of starting simple and building incrementally. The choice to make AI functionality optional with a fallback shows maturity in design thinking - too many projects fail because they depend on unreliable external services.

The main concern is not about feasibility (the project is definitely achievable) but about maximizing the learning opportunity within the 1.5-month timeframe. With AI assistance, this MVP could be completed in 2-3 weeks, leaving substantial time unused. I recommend the student consider this a great baseline and plan to implement at least 1-2 of the "nice-to-have" features as part of the primary plan, not just as stretch goals.

The absence of a timeline is the most significant procedural gap. Adding weekly milestones will help the student stay on track and make it easier to identify if they're ahead of schedule (good time to add features) or behind (good time to cut optional features).

Overall assessment: This is a well-thought-out proposal that is approved for proceeding. With the addition of a timeline and minor enhancements to technical specifications, this project is well-positioned for successful completion and should result in a functional, useful application.
